# 👋 Hello Venn

Welcome, fellow builder!  
This repository is your quick start guide to Venn intergration for smart contracts and dApps. Think of it as your "Hello World" for Venn, designed to get you up and running in 10 minutes or less. 🏆

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a secure, Venn-enabled Safe Vault demo dApp.

## Your Demo dApp - A Safe Vault

The Safe Vault is a simple smart contract designed to help you get hands-on with Venn’s security features. Learn the basics without unnecessary complexity.

The Safe Vault contract **[SafeVault.sol](contracts/SafeVault.sol)** has the following interface:

- **`deposits`**
  a mapping between a user's address and how much ETH they have <br /><br />

- **`deposit()`**
  a method for users to deposit ETH to the vault <br /><br />

- **`withdraw()`**
  a method for users to withdraw previously deposited ETH <br /><br />

## Prerequisits

- A wallet with some at Holesky ETH in it, if you need testnet tokens, you can get them from a faucet such as [Google Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/holesky)

## Step 0 / Setup

Before we dive into integrating Venn, let’s ensure the demo dApp is correctly set up and everything works as expected.

Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repo** 🖥️  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryzwan29/hello-venn.git
   cd hello-venn
   ```

   <br />

2. **Install Dependencies** 📦  

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

   <br />

3. **Setup Environment Variables** 🔑  
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set the values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Make sure to set the following environment variables:
   - **`PRIVATE_KEY`**
      the key you will use for deploying this contract <br /><br />

   - **`HOLESKY_RPC_URL`**
      the RPC URL to connect to Holesky <br /><br />

   - **`VENN_PRIVATE_KEY`**
      used by the `venn-cli` to send Venn setup transactions. Usually, this would be the same as your **`PRIVATE_KEY`** <br /><br /><br />

4. **Run Tests** 🧪

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   All tests pass, and we can continue to the next step.
   <br /><br />

## Step 1 / Add Venn To Your Smart Contracts

Now that your demo dApp is set up, it’s time to make your smart contracts `Venn Ready`. In this step, we’ll integrate Venn’s security framework into the Safe Vault contract using the `venn-cli`.

This integration will:

- Add Venn-Modifiers to your contract.
- Prepare your contract to use Venn’s security infrastructure without changing its existing functionality.
- Enable Venn, and move from `Venn Ready` to `Venn Enabled` in **Step 2** below.

1. **Install Venn CLI** 📦  

   ```bash
   npm i -g @vennbuild/cli
   ```

   <br />

2. **Run the CLI on our contracts** 🛠️  

   ```bash
   venn fw integ -d contracts
   ```

   > **Note:** On the first run, this will also install the `@ironblocks/firewall-consumer` SDK package

   <br />

3. **Review Changes to `SafeVault.sol`** 🔎  

   - An import for **`VennFirewallConsumer`** was added
   - The contract now inherits the **`VennFirewallConsumer`**
   - External methods are now **`firewallProtected`**

   <br />

4. **Verify Tests Still Pass** 🧪

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   <br />

5. **Deploy** 🚀

   ```bash
   npm run step:1:deploy
   ```

   <br />

6. **End 2 End Tests** ☘️

   ```bash
   npm run step:1:deposit
   npm run step:1:withdraw
   ```

   Now that our contracts are **`Venn Ready`**, let's move on to making them **`Venn Enabled`**.

   <br />

## Step 2 / Enable Venn

With your smart contracts now `Venn Ready`, it’s time to activate Venn’s security features. Using the `venn-cli`, we’ll enable real-time protection, ensuring your contracts are safeguarded against malicious transactions.

1. **Enable Venn** 🛡️  

   ```bash
   venn enable --network holesky
   ```

   Our **`SafeVault`** is now protected by Venn.

   <br />

2. **Venn Policy Address** 📌

   The CLI also prints out the address of our new `Venn Policy`
   ![Venn Policy](https://storage.googleapis.com/venn-engineering/venn-cli/venn-policy.png) <br />
   We'll need it in the next step, so go ahead and copy it into the **`venn.config.json`** file as follows:

   ```json
   {
      "networks": {
         "holesky": {
               "contracts": {
                  "SafeVault": "..."
               },
               "policyAddress": "PASTE YOUR POLICY ADDRESS HERE"
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   <br />

3. **But Now Everything's Broken** 😱  

   If we now try to deposit or withdraw, our transactions will fail

   ```bash
   npm run step:2:deposit
   npm run step:2:withdraw
   ```

   This is because Venn only allows approved transactions to go through.  
   So, how do we get our transactions approved by Venn?

   <br />

## Step 3 / Add Venn SDK To Your Frontend

To complete your integration, we’ll use the `Venn dApp SDK` to ensure every transaction from your frontend is securely validated before being sent on-chain.

1. **Install The SDK** 📦  

   ```bash
   npm i @vennbuild/venn-dapp-sdk
   ```

   <br />

2. **Review The SDK Code** 🖥️  

   For the purpose of this guide, we took the liberty of preparing all the code in advance, so you don't have to. <br /><br />

   Checkout the integration code in the file **[step-3/deposit.ts](scripts/step-3/deposit.ts)**:

   ```typescript
   const vennClient = new VennClient({
        vennURL: VENN_SIGNER_URL,
        vennPolicyAddress: VENN_POLICY_ADDRESS
   });

   ...

   const approvedTx = await vennClient.approve({
      from: owner.address,
      to: SAFE_VAULT_ADDRESS,
      value: hre.ethers.parseEther("0.0001").toString(),
      data: safeVault.interface.encodeFunctionData("deposit")
   });
   ```

   <br />

3. **Run Approved Transactions** 📦  

   With the Venn DApp SDK installed, our updated **`deposit`** and **`withdraw`** scripts are now working again: <br /><br />

   ```bash
   npm run step:3:deposit
   npm run step:3:withdraw
   ```

   <br />

   > **TIP:** *See these transactions on the [Venn Explorer](https://explorer.venn.build)*
